Words, idioms, and sentences mean different things in different contexts, and this goes beyond mere ambiguity.

## Language games

Wittgenstein ("Philosophical Investigations") says that the meaning of a word is in the role it plays in the _language game_. People do many things with language, as language is involved in many activities. Each of these activities use words in their own way. And that there's no use looking for an intrinsic meaning of the word on its own (what it points to).

"That is a big elephant": this elephant is big, for an elephant.
"That's a big difference": this difference is larger than 20%

"Can I have two white breads?": "two" will make the baker start counting, or grab two breads at once
"Kangaroos have two legs": the number "two" is stored a relation of the Kangaroo concept
"two plus two is four": "two (2) is used to check an expression
"my brother is two years younger": approximately 2 years, 1.5 year - 2.5 year

Each language game has its own use (procedure) of a word. What would be the equivalent of a language game in NLI-GO?

## Toy problems

AI systems are often said to solve only [toy problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_problem), and that the system does not scale to real world problems. But what if the world is just a combination of a great deal of toy problems?
