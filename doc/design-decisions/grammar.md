## Constructions

NLI-GO's grammar has the lexicon combined with the grammar. The reason is that this facilitates the use of idioms, which are more common in natural language than we use to think. Construction Grammar is based on this idea.

Idioms may be constructions that would normally be ungrammatical, such as "by and large".
Idioms are not always fixed strings, but may also be patterns, such, "as <AdjP> as <NP>".

Such a combination of lexiocon and grammar is called a _constructicon_, it's grammar of constructions, that contains a mix of phrases and individual words.
