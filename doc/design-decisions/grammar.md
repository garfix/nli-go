## Constructions

NLI-GO's grammar has the lexicon combined with the grammar. The reason is that this facilitates the use of idioms, which are more common in natural language than we use to think. Construction Grammar is based on this idea.

Idioms may be constructions that would normally be ungrammatical, such as "by and large".
Idioms are not always fixed strings, but may also be patterns, such, "as <AdjP> as <NP>".

Such a combination of lexicon and grammar is called a _constructicon_, it's grammar of constructions, that contains a mix of phrases and individual words.

Note that construction grammar also pleads for the same treatment of morphology as syntax. This is an interesting option I'd like to apply NLI-GO.

## No thematic roles

Why doesn't the grammar support thematic roles? Thematic roles as AGENT, PATIENT, THEME, are mainly used to separate legitimate from illegitimate constructions. They are neither useful to interpret a sentence, nor to generate one. Furthermore, thematic roles are complex and have many idiosyncrasies.
