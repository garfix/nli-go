Wittgenstein ("Philosophical Investigations") tells us to see the meaning of a word as the way it is used. A word is not a reference to an object, nor definition in the mind, nor a platonic idea. However, referencing can be a possible use of a word, and for some words this is the main use.

NLI-GO implements the meaning of a word as a procedure, and this can be seen as a description of its use. Noteably, some procedures serve as definitions (or senses), but others have a purely algorithmic (or procedural) implementation.
