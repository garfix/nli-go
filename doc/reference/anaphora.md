# Anaphora resolution

What is the algorithm for anaphora resulution? Simple question. Not so simple to answer. What can we say about it?

## The facts

Any noun phrase is a reference. It is a description of an entity and what that entity is, needs to be discovered. And since anaphora is so common for noun phrases, it makes sense to treat any noun phrase as anaphoric.

Anaphora has the following aspects

- references to discourse entities (anaphoric) vs references without discourse entities; these refer to the world (nonanaphoric)
- references to determinate entities ("the", names) (definite references) vs indeterminate entities ("a") (indefinite references)
- definite vs indefinte references ("the car", "a car") ("If Pedro owns some donkey, he beats it.")
- references to concepts ("whats the action radius of an electric car?") 
- plural vs singular references ("they", "she")
- pronouns ("it") vs descriptions ("the blue car")
- the type of entity is often specified ("the car")
- reflexive ("himself") vs nonreflexive ("him")
- within sentence references (intrasentential) vs references to other sentences (intersentential)
- back-references (anaphoric) vs forward references (cataphoric)
- direct references ("the car") vs indirect references (referring to an entity that can be deduced) ("My car broke down. The engine failed.")
- may require complex interpretation via world knowledge / selectional restrictions ("The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they [feared/advocated] violence.")
- it may refer to NP's but also to VP's and S's.
- one-anaphora. "How many blocks are in the box? Pick one out." ("one" refers to any block)

What are the linguistically relevant features of the entities (anaphors) refered to? They have

- a gender: male, female
- animatedness: animate, inanimate
- number: singular, plural (entities that are known as a group)
- a type: car, person, thing, activity
- selectional restrictions: (the things they can do, "birds fly", "cars brake down")
- a domain: in the discourse, in a conceptual structure, in the world

What are the features of the references? They have

- a domain: in the discourse ("he"), conceptually related entities ("the engine of the car"), in the world ("My car")
- a number: singular, plural
- a phrase type: noun, verb
- animatedness: animate ("she"), inanimate ("it")
- a gender: male, female
- a specification: car, person, thing, on the left, that my mother liked
- a focus: single entity (definite), set of entities (indefinite)
- a lexical scope: reflexive (same clause), intersentential, intrasentential
- a direction: anaphora (backward), cataphora (forward)
- a phrase type: noun, verb
