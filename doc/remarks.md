I noticed that the original SHRDLU demo used animations when moving objects around in the scene. And since this is an important part of the demo, I need to duplicate this. 

I noticed that SHRDLU only says "OK" when it is done moving all objects. This means, probably, that it moves objects in the process of answering the question. I could have NLI-GO do that too, but this is not what I want. I don't want the system to be unresponsive while it is executing the task. As for a simple reason why: you would not even be able to tell the system to stop.

This means that I will separate the answerer from the goal execution engine. They will need to be activated separately. At the same time, both will be modules of the same system, and share some of the resources. This is how I image this to work:

The answerer may assert `goal` relations:

    go:assert(go:goal(GoalSet, incomplete, `id`, none))

This means: spawn a goal (specified by GoalSet, a relation set), which is as yet unfinished ("incomplete"), has an id (`id`) and no parent id (`none`).

I will create a system command: 

    run(maxTime)

that tries to advance the incomplete goals by executing their goal sets. The `maxTime` argument may tell the system how long it should run maximally. For now it is not important. But it can be used to run this process each minute in a cron job or something.

A goal set, or any subgoal it invokes, may create actions. An action is a signal to external modules that something needs to be done.

    go:assert(go:action(ActionSet, <actionType>, incomplete, `id`))

The goal executor will halt until the action is completed. The action type can be used by external modules to listen to specific actions.

Finally, I will add another system command to notify the system that an action has been performed, or has failed: 

    updateActionState(actionId, newState) 

The web application then serves as the not-so-physical representation of the robot, that performs actions by creating animations. When the user enters a line of text, the web app will call `answer`. When this is done, it will call `run` to advance the system, and then `query` to ask for the pending actions. It will perform these actions by creating animations, and then call `updateActionState`, followed by another `run`, as long as the action query gives more results.

Isn't this a awful lot of work just to add some animation? Yes, if it were just for the animations, this much work would be unwarranted. But this is also a preparation for the agent that is necessary to perform much more complex tasks, and to create the goal hierarchy that is needed to answer the following 15 questions of the SHRDLU demo interaction.

I created a stack trace! It is output when the answerer finds no results. It is an automation of what I have been doing all along to fix a program. 

An object called CallStack keeps track of the functions being called recursively. When a function gives no results, a copy of the stack at that time is frozen.

Here's an example stack trace that is created when I try to fit a block into the box that doesn't fit:

    Stack trace

        {ColIndex$5:4, Index$6:4, Line$6:1000, VerLines$2:[600, 640, 800, 840, 1000], W$6:0, Width$25:200, X1$18:1000}&{A1$1:0, A1$2:-1, B1$1:200, B1$2:-1, StartY$1:200, StartY$2:600, Success$11:true, Success$12:true, Success$14:true, Success$15:true, Success$3:true, Success$4:true, Success$7:true, Success$8:true}

       {}

This is very useful! It makes debugging a lot easier, I expect. What you also see here is that some constructs are very heavy and this shows up in the call stack. So this is an indication that I should keep them simple.

Very happy with the fact that it was possible to create the typical oblique projection of SHRDLU with THREE.JS. The demo is coming along fine. I am now working on the hand, which a largely ignored up to now, but which has such an important role in the demo. It hit on me a few days ago that the hand actually moves smoothly in the SHRDLU demo. In the database it just switches to a new position, so this is an important difference that I will need to find a solution for.

The hand picks up a block in the center, and when the hand moves up, the block should follow. The block is not at the same position as the hand of course, it must be translated.

Since I now have an interactive blocks world demo, I can interact with it immediately and try different sentences. They all break down in terrible ways! I have seen cubes floating in space, cubes taking up the same space, execution times of 5 seconds... Wow. This thing is not robust by any means.

However, I fixed the first problems I encountered. And I made an interesting innovation: I added an extra rules layer of "physics". This layer of rules is responsible for ensuring that all relations (contain, support, cleartop) stay intact, whatever you do. All objects that move now go trough a single function `phys_move_object`. This function has as input just the position of the object. It breaks up any existing relations the object might have, and then rebuilds them, just by looking at the position of the object. I was afraid that this would be very expensive, and it is not cheap, but the enormous advantage is that you can now move objects around without thinking about the relations _at all_. They have been fixed in a special layer once and for all.
