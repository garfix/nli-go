The interactive demo doesn't work anymore. I know what's wrong with it: the dialog context is being rebuild at times that it shouldn't and this disturbs the process. The reason is that the process is restarted many times during the ansering of a single sentence. And that's ok for the processes, but not for the dialog entities and the clause list.

This is the drop. The process was already too slow; it had to redo the same code multiple times; and the grammars had to be reloaded. I've had enought: I'm going to build a real service. I'll turn nli-go into a service that keeps running. Nice!

===

There will be an application that listens to a port for incoming JSON messages. 
A dispatcher listens for incoming messages. A message will have a dialog id.
When this id is new, a new dialog context is created, and started. Then the message is passed to the dialog context.

I found this example https://gist.github.com/miguelmota/301340db93de42b537df5588c1380863

send message to port:

    echo "Hello" | netcat localhost 3333

Changed go:equals() and go:not_equals() to    

    [T1 == T2]
    [T1 != T2]

Changed numerical comparisons to

    [T1 > T2]
    [T1 >= T2]
    [T1 < T2]
    [T1 <= T2]

Changed assignment to

    [V1 := T1]

Changed operations (see below for explanation) to

    [T1 + T2]
    [T1 - T2]
    [T1 / T2]
    [T1 * T2]

=== 

I want to rewrite go:add(T1, T2, Result) and like procedures to 

    [T1 + T2]

a possibility:

    go:eval(Result, go:add(T1, T2, Result))

and have assignment recognize `go:eval()` as a special case

Other possibility

    go:add(T1, T2)

and have procedure calling recognize that the last argument is missing; let it create an internal variable; and work with its result. This way we can use procedures as functions with very little overhead.

I will make this because it's such an interesting idea. You can also use it with facts from the database, like this:

    age(pat, 51)
    age(sue, 49)

    older(A, B) :- [age(A) > age(B)];

It's hard to change the process runner to have it create a child frame for each of the arguments, so for the moment I will have it execute the arguments immediately.

===

I don't have access tp the number of arguments, so for the moment I will do it a bit different:

    older(A, B) :- [age(A, return) > age(B, rv)];

Where the atom `return` takes the place of the return value.

I added some keywords to mentalese:

old:

    go:if_then_else(
        go:not(cleartop(E2)) do_find_free_space(E2, E1, X1, Y1),
        do_put_on_position(ParentEventId, E1, E2, X1, Y1),
        do_cleartop(ParentEventId, E2) do_put_on_center(ParentEventId, E1, E2)
    )

new:

    if go:not(cleartop(E2)) do_find_free_space(E2, E1, X1, Y1) then
        do_put_on_position(ParentEventId, E1, E2, X1, Y1)
    else
        do_cleartop(ParentEventId, E2) do_put_on_center(ParentEventId, E1, E2)
    end

I created the keywords `return`, `fail`, `break` and `cancel`.

I removed `let()` and introduced `[X = n]` for both `let()` and most forms of `unify()`. I kept `unify()` because there were some valid use cases for it.

===

The processes I created work well, but I don't want to impose them on any other developer, because he would go insane quite quickly. Also, they cause a lot of code to be run multiple times unnecessaily. So I'm thinking of using some sort of Promises (see javascript) or async/await.

One of the main points of the processes is that an application may be killed at any time, and the proces still knows its state. If can continue where it left off.

This is what I did: update these discourse entity values while processing the sentence. For example in `addToQueue`? This would not _add to the queue_, but update the discourse entity variables.

This then finally allowed me to run all 25 interactions, and remove the anaphora queue. But it became very clear to me that anaphora resolution is far from solved. The list of open problems is large. There's a long way to go before this subject is solved to satisfaction.

Great article "The defeat of the Winograd Schema Challenge" https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.02387v1.pdf

It refers to this article that may be interesting:

A. Kehler, L. Kertz, H. Rohde, J. L. Elman, Coherence and coreference revisited, Journal of semantics 25 (2008) 1–44.

from this, an example of subject preference

    a. Bush narrowly defeated Kerry, and special interests promptly began lobbying him. [¼Bush]
    b. Kerry was narrowly defeated by Bush, and special interests promptly began lobbying him. [¼Kerry]

    "The alternation found in examples (6a,b) can be used to argue for the existence of a grammatical subject preference."

also

    the grammatical role parallelism preference which favours referents that occupy the same grammatical role as the pronoun.

===

Maybe I can update these discourse entity values while processing the sentence? For example in `addToQueue`? This would not _add to the queue_, but update it.

The problem is that `back_reference()` needs access to non-local information.

Is it possible to do anaphora resolution as a separate step?

## 2022-01-11

Nested entities have less priority than root entities.

Discourse entity values are not present while creating the anaphora queue, since they are only added at the end...

## 2022-01-10

A discourse variable often contains multiple values. Up until now I used a simple binding for discourse variables, but they could not store multiple values per variable. I thought of creating a new structure, but then I thought: what if I create a new type of term type: entity ids? But then I saw I already had an array type: the list.

Combinding multiple bindings in a single binding with multiple lists is all fine. But what about extracting these lists into multiple bindings? This can lead very quickly to a large number of bindings in an ongoing dialog.

The discourse entities may contain lists, and that's ok. These lists are not actively used any more.

"Had you touched any pyramid before you put [the green one] on the little cube?" contains a within-clause reference. And it causes a problem with the new implementation.

## 2022-01-09

Whenever a definite reference is asked, the system creates a temporary anaphora queue. It is built like this:

    for each of the root clauses, from last to first
        add all entities in order of priority

## 2022-01-07

On 5 January I managed to run all 25 interactions without any errors (!)

I still have to replace the anaphora queue and the sentences list with the new clause list.

===

A single root clause can contain multiple clauses. They may have references within the root clause.

    John mended the vase that he broke.

Highlighting the centers in the last interactions of the dialog:

[] = new center
() = retain center

    H: Had [you] touched any pyramid before you put the green one on the little cube?     // subject has highest prio (syntax)
    S: Yes, [the green one]                                                               // the answer entity gets to be the center (auto)  
    H: When did you pick (it) up?                                                         // back_reference() is calculated and yields the entity (solve!)  
    S: While I was stacking up a large red block, a large green cube and the red cube     // has no answer entities, so keep (it) ! (auto)
    H: Why (did you pick (it) up)?                                                        // ellipsis resolution creates the same entity for 'it' (auto)  
    S: To get rid of (it)                                                                 // note: write grammar (lookup of center)

Problems to solve

- `back_reference` needs access to the active clause of current input
- `update center` needs the sentence to be solved because it needs the result of the `back_reference()`s   

Todo

- I need to do `go:dialog_add_root_clause(RootClauseTree, false)` before the `solve` phase so that `back_reference` can use the latest clause.
- Update the center at a later time (when?) create a new relation for it

## 2022-01-05

I must implement all entities with atoms. Currently they are variables, but it means that variables are used as values, and this is clumsy. Then there must be a mapping from these atoms to database ids.

## 2022-01-01

Perhaps there can be an extra processing step in `respond.rule` that locates the backward-looking center of the new sentence.
