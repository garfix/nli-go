Very happy with the fact that it was possible to create the typical oblique projection of SHRDLU with THREE.JS. The demo is coming along fine. I am now working on the hand, which a largely ignored up to now, but which has such an important role in the demo. It hit on me a few days ago that the hand actually moves smoothly in the SHRDLU demo. In the database it just switches to a new position, so this is an important difference that I will need to find a solution for.

The hand picks up a block in the center, and when the hand moves up, the block should follow. The block is not at the same position as the hand of course, it must be translated.
