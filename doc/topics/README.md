These topics distill the knowledge that was gained during the course of this project. I found it useful to split up each topic in several aspects:

- linguistics: what linguistic phenomenon does this topic cover?
- considerations: all problems and restrictions that go with it
- solution: data structures and algorithms that handle the topic at a logical level (NLI-GO independent)
- implementation: implementation in NLI-GO
- code: how the programmer uses it in NLI-GO

The first three aspects are interesting are not specific to NLI-GO, and this knowledge can be used in other projects as well.

_Linguistics_ is important because it describes te phenomena that could be implemented in a system. All of them are optional, but it's important to know that they exist, for this is not obvious.

_Considerations_ may help other projects not to reinvent the wheel.

The _solution_ is the essence of this research project, or any project of computational linguistics for that matter. Each solution that is more elegant than the ones before, helps the progress of this discipline.

_Implementation_ is mainly for someone who wants to work on NLI-GO as a system developer.

_Code_ is for the developer that wants to use the linguistic phenomenon in their project.
