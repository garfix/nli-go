## How to choose between ambiguous items?

Possible solution: pick the first, rely on the order of processing.

Better: pick the best, and give each alternative a score.

Anaphoric referents are scored, as well as alternative parses.

Scoring is the only option if you want to make explicit that something is ambiguous to the user. If the best 2 or more items have an equal score, then the item is ambiguous.
