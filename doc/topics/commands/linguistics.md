In a command, the user tells the system what to do.

    H: Pick up a big red block    
    C: OK

A command usually takes the form of an imperative, which is a verb phrase without a subject. But it can also take the form of a interrogative:

    H: Will you please stack up both of the red blocks and either a green cube or a pyramid?
    C: OK

The system answers with an acknowledgement and executes the request.
