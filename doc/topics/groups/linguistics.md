# Linguistics

This is the topic of entities that represent a group of individuals. This topic is often ignored, but both very important and hard to get right. 

It is hard, because the entity has two aspects. The entity is a group, but also a set of individuals.

For example:

    Is there a large block behind a pyramid?
    Yes, three of them: a large red one, a large green cube and the blue one

    Put a small one onto the green cube which supports a pyramid
    OK

The first question results in a group of large blocks. The group is described my naming the individuals. The second question is about a single individual of the group.
