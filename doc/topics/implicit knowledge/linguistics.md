A sentence may imply syntactic and semantic information that is not used directly to build the meaning of the sentence, but may still be used to respond to it.

When I say:

    When did you pick it up?

You can see that this sentence is in past tense. This tense information is available in the syntax rules, but it does not end up in the sense of the sentence. It's meta information. Even if is added to the sense, it would still be useful to make it accessible as a fact, to the solver.

This can also go much further, by suggesting the current script, with its usual roles.

    Sally went into a restaurant.

Instantiates the restaurant script with Sally as the main subject.
