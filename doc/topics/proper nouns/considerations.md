# Proper nouns - considerations

## Can we detect proper nouns before parsing the sentence?

Proper nouns are written with capitals in English, so that seems a good way to find them. However, this quickly proves a bad idea.

    Is Sally John's brother?

Are "Sally" and "John" two names, or is "Sally John" a single name?

Also, from personal experience, I noticed that people tend to write names in all lowercase:

    who married michael jackson?

but of course we can teach our users to write correct sentences.

And thoses are just the problems with human names. Things have names too. A name like "Commodore 64" will fall outside the words-with-capitals scheme.
